    "#TensorFlow Core Learning Algorithms In this notebook we will walk through 4 fundemental machine learning algorithms. We will apply each of these algorithms to unique problems and datasets before highlighting the use cases of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms we will focus on include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression\n",
    "Classification\n",
    "Clustering\n",
    "Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "It is worth noting that there are many tools within TensorFlow that could be used to solve the problems we will see below. I have chosen the tools that I belive give the most variety and are easiest to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Linear Regression Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use a linear model to predict the survival rate of passangers from the titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is based on the following documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear\n",
    "\n",
    "###How it Works Before we dive in, I will provide a very surface level explination of the linear regression algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of a data set with one feature and one label.\n",
    "\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "‚Äã\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4]\n",
    "y = [1, 4, 7, 9, 15]\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, 'ro')\n",
    "plt.axis([0, 6, 0, 20])\n",
    "We can see that this data has a linear coorespondence. When the x value increases, so does the y. Because of this relation we can create a line of best fit for this dataset. In this example our line will only use one input variable, as we are working with two dimensions. In larger datasets with more features our line will have more features and inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points.\" (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/line-of-best-fit.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a refresher on the equation of a line in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "ùë¶=ùëöùë•+ùëè\n",
    "Here's an example of a line of best fit for this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y, 'ro')\n",
    "plt.axis([0, 6, 0, 20])\n",
    "plt.plot(np.unique(x), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(x, y, 1))(np.unique(x)))\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "Once we've generated this line for our dataset, we can use its equation to predict future values. We just pass the features of the data point we would like to predict into the equation of the line and use the output as our prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup and Imports\n",
    "Before we get started we must install sklearn and import the following modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "!pip install -q sklearn\n",

    "Data\n",
    "So, if you haven't realized by now a major part of machine learning is data! In fact, it's so important that most of what we do in this tutorial will focus on exploring, cleaning and selecting appropriate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be focusing on here is the titanic dataset. It has tons of information about each passanger on the ship. Our first step is always to understand the data and explore it. So, let's do that!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Below we will load a dataset and learn how we can explore it using some built-in tools. *\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load dataset.\n",
    "dftrain = pd.read_csv('https://storage.googleapis.com/tf-datasets/titanic/train.csv') # training data\n",
    "dfeval = pd.read_csv('https://storage.googleapis.com/tf-datasets/titanic/eval.csv') # testing data\n",
    "y_train = dftrain.pop('survived')\n",
    "y_eval = dfeval.pop('survived')\n",
    "The pd.read_csv() method will return to us a new pandas dataframe. You can think of a dataframe like a table. In fact, we can actually have a look at the table representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've decided to pop the \"survived\" column from our dataset and store it in a new variable. This column simply tells us if the person survived our not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To look at the data we'll use the .head() method from pandas. This will show us the first 5 items in our dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "dftrain.head()\n",
    "And if we want a more statistical analysis of our data we can use the .describe() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "dftrain.describe()\n",
    "And since we talked so much about shapes in the previous tutorial let's have a look at that too!\n",
    "\n",
    "dftrain.shape\n",
    "So have have 627 entries and 9 features, nice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's have a look at our survival information.\n",
    "\n",
    "y_train.head()\n",
    "Notice that each entry is either a 0 or 1. Can you guess which stands for survival?\n",
    "\n",
    "And now because visuals are always valuable let's generate a few graphs of the data.\n",

    "pd.concat([dftrain, y_train], axis=1).groupby('sex').survived.mean().plot(kind='barh').set_xlabel('% survive')\n",
    "After analyzing this information, we should notice the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most passengers are in their 20's or 30's\n",
    "Most passengers are male\n",
    "Most passengers are in \"Third\" class\n",
    "Females have a much higher chance of survival\n",
    "Training vs Testing Data\n",
    "You may have noticed that we loaded two different datasets above. This is because when we train models, we need two sets of data: training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is what we feed to the model so that it can develop and learn. It is usually a much larger size than the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing data is what we use to evaulate the model and see how well it is performing. We must use a seperate set of data that the model has not been trained on to evaluate it. Can you think of why this is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the point of our model is to be able to make predictions on NEW data, data that we have never seen before. If we simply test the model on the data that it has already seen we cannot measure its accuracy accuratly. We can't be sure that the model hasn't simply memorized our training data. This is why we need our testing and training data to be seperate.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Feature Columns In our dataset we have two different kinds of information: Categorical and Numeric\n",
    "\n",
    "Our categorical data is anything that is not numeric! For example, the sex column does not use numbers, it uses the words \"male\" and \"female\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue and create/train a model we must convet our categorical data into numeric data. We can do this by encoding each category with an integer (ex. male = 1, female = 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us TensorFlow has some tools to help!\n",
    "\n",
    "CATEGORICAL_COLUMNS = ['sex', 'n_siblings_spouses', 'parch', 'class', 'deck',\n",

    "\n",
    "Essentially what we are doing here is creating a list of features that are used in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cryptic lines of code inside the append() create an object that our model can use to map string values like \"male\" and \"female\" to integers. This allows us to avoid manually having to encode our dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is some relevant documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list?version=stable\n",
    "\n",
    "###The Training Process So, we are almost done preparing our dataset and I feel as though it's a good time to explain how our model is trained. Specifically, how input data is fed to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific model data is going to be streamed into it in small batches of 32. This means we will not feed the entire dataset to our model at once, but simply small batches of entries. We will feed these batches to our model multiple times according to the number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An epoch is simply one stream of our entire dataset. The number of epochs we define is the amount of times our model will see the entire dataset. We use multiple epochs in hope that after seeing the same data multiple times the model will better determine how to estimate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. if we have 10 ephocs, our model will see the same dataset 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to feed our data in batches and multiple times, we need to create something called an input function. The input function simply defines how our dataset will be converted into batches at each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Input Function The TensorFlow model we are going to use requires that the data we pass it comes in as a tf.data.Dataset object. This means we must create a input function that can convert our current pandas dataframe into that object.\n",

    "Below you'll see a seemingly complicated input function, this is straight from the TensorFlow documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear).

    "States: In each markov model we have a finite set of states. These states could be something like \"warm\" and \"cold\" or \"high\" and \"low\" or even \"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\". These states are \"hidden\" within the model, which means we do not direcly observe them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations: Each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution. An example of this is the following: On a hot day Tim has a 80% chance of being happy and a 20% chance of being sad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitions: Each state will have a probability defining the likelyhood of transitioning to a different state. An example is the following: a cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day and a 70% chance of being follwed by another cold day.\n",
